# blockchain-simulator
## COL867: Assignment 1
The root directory contains these files:
1) blockChainSimulator.cpp : It contains the blockchain simulator code.
2) makeGraph.sh : It creates python scripts which can be used for visualization purposes.
3) Makefile : It is used to compile and run the file blockChainSimulator.cpp
4) README.md : This very file.

Instructions to run the simulator:
1) Open a terminal in the root directory.
2) Type 'make'

Instructions to run python scripts:
1) Make sure that simulator was run before successfully, as the simulator itself generates the python scripts
2) Give executable permission to makeGraph.sh if not given already, i.e. run chmod +x makeGraph.sh
3) Type ./makeGraph.sh
4) Check the root directory for the newly created/updated image files.
